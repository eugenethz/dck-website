They gave me a step-by-step process on how to avoid mould from growing and the damage mould can have on your health. Deep Clean King treated the mould problem in my rental property in January 2023, and no issues whatsoever. My health started to improve once the mould was removed safely and effectively. If only I could give them more than 5 stars, highly recommended.",
